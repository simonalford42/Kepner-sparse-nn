  Creates an X-net sparse network topology from the input parameters using Ryan's
  Extended Mixed-Radix method. See the documentation for a full 
  explanation of what is going on.

  Inputs:
  radix_lists - A list of lists of radices to be used for the [possibly extended]
      mixed radix system. The number of entries is the number of layers in the 
      network W that is output.

  Returns:
  layers - A list of numpy arrays where the i'th entry is the weight matrix W_i
      for the i'th layer.
  info   - A dict containing info about the layers with the following key/values:
      shape: a tuple containing the number of neurons for each layer. NOTE:
      this includes the input and output layers. as a result, 
      len(shape) = len(layers) + 1. That is, layers doesn't give the input weights.
      For the EMR method, the number of neurons is the same for each layer.
      paths: the number of possible paths between each input and output neuron.
      sparsity: the sparsity of the network (fraction of entries which are zero)
      connections_per_neuron: the average number of outgoing connections per neuron
